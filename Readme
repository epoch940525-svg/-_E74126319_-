專案概念

本計畫探討一種「主動回應噪音的住宅」。
不同於依賴厚重牆體、隔音材料或封閉邊界的作法，本設計提出另一種可能性：噪音在抵達建築之前就被處理。建築不再等待聲音進入，而是透過形塑周圍空間，提前對噪音做出回應。
住宅本體保持穩定、不變形；真正產生變化的是其周邊地表。草地、鋪面與開放空間成為一層具回應性的緩衝帶，透過空間形變來吸收、引導或抵抗噪音。

1. 從圖像到建築
本計畫起始於一個二維的演進圖示。
在此階段中，噪音被抽象為點，空間則以中性的網格表示。當噪音點靠近時，網格會產生推擠或拉動，而類似彈簧的回復力則不斷嘗試將系統拉回平衡狀態。這個圖示並非物理或聲學模擬，而是一種行為模型。
它用來視覺化空間在受到干擾時可能產生的反應，以及距離、強度與重複性如何促成空間變化。此演進圖成為後續所有建築決策的概念基礎。

2. 三維空間轉譯
當概念被轉譯至三維尺度時，圖像邏輯並未直接套用在建築本體上。
住宅本身不彎曲、不傾斜、也不變形；取而代之的是周邊地表成為主動回應的元素。草地與鋪面在垂直方向上產生隆起或下陷，同時仍然錨定於基地之上。這樣的變形被理解為「拉伸」，而非整體位移，確保地表的連續性與穩定感，而非被掀起或漂浮。
最終形成的是一個在視覺與空間層面上對噪音產生回應的環境，而住宅本體則維持冷靜且穩定，位於其核心。

3. 兩種噪音角色
本計畫定義了兩種不同的噪音角色，各自引發不同的空間反應。
第一種為「主人」，象徵熟悉且可接受的存在。當主人靠近時，周邊地表會下凹，形成凹形的空間變化，引導動線、創造通往住宅的通道。在此情境下，噪音並未被排除，而是被接納。
第二種為「外人」，代表陌生或不受歡迎的存在。當此類噪音靠近時，地表會隆起，形成凸起的空間屏障，阻擋聲音並限制直接接近住宅。隱私不再透過牆體建立，而是藉由地表轉變所形塑。

4. 設計意圖
在本計畫中，隱私並非透過封閉或隔離來定義，而是來自於回應。
建築不再以剛性的邊界切割內外，而是透過空間行為與環境協商彼此的關係。噪音不再只是需要被阻擋的外在問題，而成為一種能夠主動形塑空間的力量。
最終的建築形式，呈現的是這種回應被「凝結」後的狀態——一個已被聲音、存在與距離所塑造的地景。

Project Concept

This project explores the idea of a house that actively responds to noise, rather than passively blocking it.
Instead of relying on thick walls, heavy insulation, or enclosed boundaries, the project proposes a different approach: noise is addressed before it reaches the house. The architecture does not wait for sound to arrive, but shapes the surrounding space in response to it.
The house itself remains stable and undeformed. What changes is the ground around it. Grass, pavement, and open surfaces become a responsive buffer zone, absorbing, redirecting, or resisting noise through spatial deformation.

1.From Diagram to Architecture

The project begins with a two-dimensional evolution diagram.
In this early stage, noise is abstracted as points, and space is represented as a neutral grid. When noise points approach, the grid is pushed or pulled, while spring-like forces continuously attempt to return the system to equilibrium. This diagram is not intended as a physical or acoustic simulation, but as a behavioral model.
It visualizes how space might react when disturbed, and how proximity, intensity, and repetition can produce spatial change. This diagram becomes the conceptual foundation for all later architectural decisions.

2.Spatial Translation into 3D

When translated into three dimensions, the logic of the diagram is not applied directly to the building itself.
The house does not bend, tilt, or deform. Instead, the surrounding ground becomes the active element. Grass and pavement respond vertically, creating rises and depressions while remaining anchored to the site. The deformation is understood as stretching rather than displacement, ensuring that the ground feels continuous and grounded rather than lifted or detached.
The result is an environment that visually and spatially reacts to noise, while the house remains calm and stable at its center.

3.Two Types of Noise

The project defines two distinct noise characters, each producing a different spatial response.
The first is the Owner, representing familiar and acceptable presence. When the owner approaches, the surrounding ground sinks. This concave deformation creates a passage, guiding movement toward the house and allowing access. Noise in this case is not rejected, but accommodated.
The second is the Outsider, representing unfamiliar or unwanted presence. When this type of noise approaches, the ground rises. The convex deformation forms a spatial barrier, redirecting sound and blocking direct access. Privacy is created not through walls, but through the transformation of the ground itself.

4.Design Intention

In this project, privacy is not defined by enclosure, but by reaction.
Rather than separating inside and outside with rigid boundaries, the house negotiates its relationship with the environment through spatial behavior. Noise is no longer an external problem to be blocked, but a force that actively shapes space.
The final architectural form represents a frozen moment of this response—a landscape already shaped by sound, presence, and distance.
